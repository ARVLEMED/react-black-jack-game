      ack is simplThe goal of blackje: have a higher hand value than the dealer, without going over 21. Players are dealt two cards and can then choose to “hit” (receive additional cards) or “stand” (keep their current hand). The dealer also receives two cards, but only one is face up. If a player’s hand exceeds 21, they “bust” and lose the game. If the dealer busts, all remaining players win. If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the player with the highest hand value wins.
