      <h2>What is Blackjack</h2>
      <p>
        Blackjack is a card game where players aim to get a hand that is closer to 21 than the dealerâ€™s hand, without going over 21. Each card is worth its face value, with face cards (Jack, Queen, King) worth 10 and Aces worth either 1 or 11. The game is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards.
      </p>
      <h3>Card Values</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Number cards (2-10): Face value.</li>
        <li>Face cards (King, Queen, Jack): Worth 10 points.</li>
        <li>Aces: Can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which is more beneficial for the hand.</li>
